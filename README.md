This repo provides a function in Unity to locate/re-locate/instantiate/move 
a virtual 3D model corresponding to their target.
This can be used when we want to locate any 3D model overlapping to their
real objects from the known 3 reference points.

We can apply in AR/XR, hope that it will be helpful :)

A sample scene in Unity showing how a virtual model (the red-tinted one) is relocated following the change of 3 reference
points in the target (the blue building).
